OSI Layers (Top to Bottom)
7. Application Layer
Closest to the end user
Provides network services to applications
Examples:
HTTP / HTTPS (web)
FTP (file transfer)
SMTP / POP3 / IMAP (email)
DNS

6. Presentation Layer

Formats, encrypts, and compresses data
Ensures data is readable by the receiving system
Functions:
Encryption / Decryption (SSL/TLS)
Data compression
Data format conversion (ASCII, JPEG, MP3)

5. Session Layer

Manages sessions between two systems
Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections
Functions:
Session checkpoints
Authentication
Recovery from interruptions

4. Transport Layer

Ensures reliable data delivery
Breaks data into segments
Provides:
Error control
Flow control
Port numbers
Protocols:
TCP → Reliable, ordered
UDP → Fast, no guarantee

3. Network Layer

Handles routing and logical addressing
Determines the best path for data
Uses IP addresses
Protocols & Devices:
IP, ICMP, IPSec
Routers

2. Data Link Layer

Provides node-to-node delivery
Uses MAC addresses
Detects and corrects errors from Physical layer
Sub-layers:
LLC
MAC
Devices & Protocols:
Switches
Ethernet, ARP

1. Physical Layer

Deals with hardware transmission
Sends raw bits (0s and 1s)
Includes:
Cables
Voltage levels
Connectors
Devices:
Hub
Repeater
Cables
